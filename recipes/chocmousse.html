    <h2>Chocolate mousse in minutes</h2>
    <p>With its timeless elegance, chocolate mousse is always in fashion. From its first appearance in France in the 1800s to then becoming the dinner party superstar of the 1970s, chocolate mousse still appears on restaurant menus today. Chocolate mousse sings of romance and is a perfect date night dessert. With only 15 minutesâ€™ prep, the mousse is then transferred to the fridge where it just hangs, its chilled environment working to firm and trap the frothy bubbles within. This, our favourite recipe, simplifies the chocolate mousse-making process. Rather than whipping the egg whites separately, in this clever recipe you beat the whole eggs for 5 minutes. What results is a light-as-air silky chocolate experience. With the double whammy of both chocolate and cocoa powder, with this recipe you are on your way to chocolate mousse heaven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g CADBURY Baking Dark Chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (55g) caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp good-quality cocoa powder, sifted</li>
        <li>300ml thickened cream, plus extra whipped cream to serve</li>
        <li>Grated chocolate, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Stir until melted. Remove bowl from heat and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Place eggs and sugar in a large bowl and beat with electric beaters for 5 minutes, or until mixture is pale, thick and doubled in volume. Fold in cocoa powder and cooled chocolate until combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip cream until thickened (be careful not to over-beat). Use a large metal spoon to carefully fold the cream into the chocolate mixture, trying to keep the mixture as light as possible. Spoon into 6 serving glasses and chill in fridge for at least 1 hour. Remove from fridge 15 minutes before serving, then top with extra whipped cream and grated chocolate to serve.</li>
    </ol>
